GravityImageView
===========================

A small simple-to-use ImageView subclass that supports gravity for image placement as well as a mix of easy-to-understand scaling types. Great for hero images or times when you need an image to scale-n-crop as well as be anchored somewhere besides merely the center.

## Usage

Using the view in xml is super easy. Just point at the desired src like you would with a standard ImageView and specify the `imageGravity` like you with `gravity` on any other view. Additionally, `imageScaleMode` will let you tweak how the image is 1:1 scaled into the view.

```xml
<com.chrisrenke.giv.GravityImageView
    android:id="@+id/hero_image"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="140dp"
    android:src="@drawable/dinosaur_2000"
    app:imageGravity="center_horizontal|bottom"
    app:imageScaleMode="crop"
    />
```
The `imageGravity` or `imageScaleMode` can also be changed programmatically.

```java
gravityImageView.setImageGravity(RIGHT|CENTER_VERTICAL);
â€¦
gravityImageView.setImageScaleMode(INSIDE);
```


## Gradle

Just add this line to your build.gradle:

```groovy
compile 'com.chrisrenke.giv:giv:1.0'
```
